Ensure you run gem-gratitude.rb in a directory which has a Gemfile and has been `bundle install`ed
gem install httparty
ruby gem-gratitude.rb

# Todo

* Apply <pre> tags around ` and ``` blocks
* Figure out GitHub urls for non GH [:homepage]'s
* Exclusion list

# Ideas

* Executable that can be run in any gem-enabled dir with having to copy the script in
* Run as webserver that parses all Gemfiles in a Workspace (containing multiple projects)
